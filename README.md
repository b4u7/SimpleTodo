# SimpleTodo
SimpleTodo is a showcase application I made for an internship. It's built using PHP 7.4, ElasticSearch and Semantic-UI.

## Tools
- PHP 7.4
- ElasticSearch
- Logstash
- Semantic-UI

## How to setup
First do `composer install`, then run `npm install` and last start logstash with the `logstash -f logstash.conf` command.

## Credits
Thanks to @TheodoorP for helping me create this project.
